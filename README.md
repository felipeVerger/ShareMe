### What I learned

In this project I learned a lot about Sanity, like how to install it and the configuration, how to create schemas, and how to fetch the data from de server with queries.
I also learned how to use Masonry Layout. 
Finally this project was my first using Tailwind and I discovered a lot about this framework and the truth is it is amazing.

### Continued development

Although I learned a lot about Tailwind and Sanity, the truth is there is a lot more to discover and understand to master this technologies.
